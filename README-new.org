* org-journal

  Adapted from http://www.emacswiki.org/PersonalDiary

  Functions to maintain a simple personal diary / journal using in Emacs.
  Feel free to use, modify and improve the code!

** Synopsis

   =org-journal= maintains a set of files where each file represents a day. Convenient bindings allow
   to create journal records in the current daily file and search within all records or specified
   time intervals. All records can be browsed and searched from the Emacs Calendar for convenience.
   All entries in a specified TODO state will be carried over to the next day. Optionally, the
   journal can also be encrypted.

   An example of a daily file (it will actually look a lot nicer, depending on your org-mode
   settings):

  ** 10:28 Company meeting
  Endless discussions about projects. Not much progress

  For the longest time, I wanted to have a cool diary app on my
  computer. However, I simply lacked the right tool for that job. After
  many hours of searching, I finally found PersonalDiary on EmacsWiki.
  PersonalDiary is a very simple diary system based on the emacs
  calendar. It works pretty well, but I don't really like that it only
  uses unstructured text.

  Thus, I spent the last two hours with making that diary use org-mode
  and represent every entry as an org-mode headline. Very cool!

  ** 15:33 Work on org-journal                                   :org-journal:
  Now my journal automatically creates the right headlines (adds the
  current time stamp if on the current day, does not add a time stamp
  for any other day). Additionally, it automatically collapses the
  headlines in the org-file to the right level (shows everything if in
  view mode, shows only headlines in new-entry-mode). Emacs and elisp
  are really cool!

  I uploaded my journal mode to marmalade and Github! Awesome!

** Quickstart

   =org-journal= is available through [[http://marmalade-repo.org/][marmalade]], [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][melpa]] and [[http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/][melpa-stable]]. So installation should be
   trivial:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    C-x package-install org-journal
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Then add =(require 'org-journal)= to your =.emacs=.

   Doing =C-x org-journal-new-entry= (or =C-c C-j=) will immediately create a journal directory in the
   default path (customized using the =org-journal-dir= variable), open a file in =org-journal-mode= and
   insert a journal entry template.

   Same command with a prefix argument (=C-u C-c C-j=) will do everything mentioned while skipping
   entry creation, which is useful for taking a look at the current journal file.

   Bindings available in =org-journal-mode=:

   - =C-c C-f= - find next entry

   - =C-c C-b= - find previous entry

   - =C-c C-j= - insert a new entry

   - =C-c C-s= - search the journal for a string

   To see available journal entries do =C-x calendar=. Bindings available in the =calendar-mode=:

   - =j= - view an entry in a new buffer

   - =C-j= - view an entry but not switch to it

   - =i j= - add a new entry

   - =f w= - search in all entries of the current week

   - =f m= - search in all entries of the current month

   - =f y= - search in all entries of the current year

   - =f f= - search in all entries of all time

   - =[= - go to previous entry

   - =]= - go to next entry

** TODO Manual

   customization, agenda vs search, integration, etc

** FAQ

*** Can I use monthly/weekly journal entries instead of daily ones?

    No, currently =org-journal= is built around the idea of daily entries.

*** Can I have multiple journals?

    No, this is not immediately possible. But it should be possible to switch the value of
    =org-journal-directory= using a custom function or directory local variables.
