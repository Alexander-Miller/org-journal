This file is also available from marmalade under the name
[[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/org-journal][org-journal]]. After
installing, add the line =(require 'org-journal)= to your /.emacs/ or
/init.el/ to activate it. You also need to specify the directory where
your journal files will be saved. You can do this by setting the
variable =org-journal-dir= (remember to add a trailing slash).
=org-journal-dir= is also a customizable variable. The default value
for =org-journal-dir= is =~/Documents/journal/=.

You can add all those calendar files to your org-agenda by adding
=org-journal-dir= to =org-agenda-files= and setting
=org-agenda-file-regexp= to include files with an all-numeric name
(=\\`[^.].*\\.org'\\|[0-9]+=). That way, you can use org-agenda to
search for /TODO/ items or tagged items in your org-journal.

Inside the journal directory, a separate file is created for each day
with a journal entry, with a file name in the format /YYYYMMDD/. Each
journal entry is an org-mode file that begins with the date on the
top, followed by a heading with the time. Any subsequent entries on
the same day are written as additional headings in the same file, with
their own time. You can customize the date and time formats using the
variables =org-journal-date-format= and =org-journal-time-format=. To
start writing a journal entry, press =C-c j=.

You can browse through existing journal entries on disk via the
calendar. All dates for which an entry is present are highlighted.
Pressing =j= will open it up for viewing. Pressing =[= or =]= will
select the date with the previous or next journal entry, respectively.
Pressing =i j= will create a new entry for the chosen date.

Quick summary:
To create a new journal entry: =C-c j=

In calendar view:
- =j= to view an entry
- =i j= to add a new entry
- =[= to go to previous entry
- =]= to go to next entry

When viewing a journal entry:
- =C-c f= to view next entry
- =C-c b= to view previous entry

A typical journal entry for a day would look like this:

(it will actually look a lot nicer, depending on your org-mode settings)

  ** 10:28 Company meeting
  Endless discussions about projects. Not much progress

  ** 11:33 Work on org-journal                                   :org-journal:
  For the longest time, I wanted to have a cool diary app on my
  computer. However, I simply lacked the right tool for that job. After
  many hours of searching, I finally found PersonalDiary on EmacsWiki.
  PersonalDiary is a very simple diary system based on the emacs
  calendar. It works pretty well, but I don't really like that it only
  uses unstructured text.

  Thus, I spent the last two hours with making that diary use org-mode
  and represent every entry as an org-mode headline. Very cool!

  ** 15:33 Work on org-journal                                   :org-journal:
  Now my journal automatically creates the right headlines (adds the
  current time stamp if on the current day, does not add a time stamp
  for any other day). Additionally, it automatically collapses the
  headlines in the org-file to the right level (shows everything if in
  view mode, shows only headlines in new-entry-mode). Emacs and elisp
  are really cool!

  ** 16:40 Work on org-journal                                   :org-journal:
  I uploaded my journal mode to marmalade and Github! Awesome!
