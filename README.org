This file is also available from marmalade under the name [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/journal][journal]].
After installing, add the line =(require 'journal)= to your /.emacs/
or /init.el/ to activate it. You also need to specify the directory
where your journal files will be saved. You can do this by setting the
variable =journal-dir= (remember to add a trailing slash). journal-dir
is also a customizable variable. The default value for =journal-dir=
is =~/Documents/journal/=.

Inside the journal directory, a separate file is created for each day
with a journal entry, with a filename in the format /YYYYMMDD/. Each
journal entry is an org-mode file that begins with the date on the
top, followed by a heading with the time. Any subsequent entries on
the same day are written as additional headings in the same file, with
their own time. You can customize the date and time formats (or
remove them entirely). To start writing a journal entry, press =C-c
j=.

You can browse through existing journal entries on disk via the
calendar. All dates for which an entry is present are highlighted.
Pressing =j= will open it up for viewing. Pressing =[= or =]= will
select the date with the previous or next journal entry, respectively.
Pressing =J= will create a new entry for the chosen date.

Quick summary:
To create a new journal entry: =C-c j=
In calendar view:
- =j= to view an entry
- =J= to add a new entry
- =[= to go to previous entry
- =]= to go to next entry
